EDA-Loan Repayment 

Loan providing companies often find it difficult to access the loan repayment likelihood of a customer. This is primarily due to either unavailability of credit history or due to insufficient data
The Company decides on the loan application based on applicantâ€™s profile, considering few risks such as :
Not approving loan of a potential customer with high likelihood to repay the loan 
Approving the loan of a customer who is more likely to default 
This case study aims to solve such problems using the method of Exploratory Data Analysis
